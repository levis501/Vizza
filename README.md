# Vizza

A collection of interactive GPU-accelerated simulations for fun and beauty. Features a friendly UI that puts you in control.

## How to play

Windows, MacOS, and Linux are supported.

Download the latest version for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/Velfi/Vizza/releases).

- For Windows: `Vizza_<version>_x64-setup.exe` OR `Vizza_<version>_x64_en-US.msi`, both are equivalent.
- For MacOS: `Vizza_<version>_aarch64.dmg` for Apple Silicon, `Vizza_<version>_x64.dmg` for Intel.
- For Linux: `Vizza-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm` or `Vizza_<version>_amd64.AppImage` or `Vizza_<version>_amd64.deb`

Then, open the downloaded file and install the app, usually by double-clicking on it. You'll have to click past security warnings because I haven't paid for a developer certificate yet.

Once the app is installed, you can run it like any other app. Presets and color schemes you create will be saved to your Documents folder.

## Simulations

### Slime Mold

Agent-based simulation where creatures follow trails to create emergent networks.

### Gray-Scott

Reaction-diffusion simulation modeling chemical reactions that create organic patterns.

### Particle Life

Multi-species particle simulation with attraction/repulsion interactions.

### Flow

Flow field simulation with particle movement patterns.

### Pellets

Particle simulation with gravity and density-based interactions.

### Gradient Editor

Create custom color schemes for the other simulations.

### Voronoi Cellular Automata

Cellular automata with Voronoi cells that move and shift.

### Moiré

Moiré patterns with distortion effects.

## Wiki

The [wiki](wiki/) explains what the simulations are actually doing — what the
settings mean in terms of what you see on screen, and which ones are worth
reaching for. Start with
[Pheromone Deposition](wiki/slime-mold/pheromone-deposition.md) if you have
Slime Mold open.
